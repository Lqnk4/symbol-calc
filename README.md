# Symbol-Calc

A simple symbolic calculator written in Haskell.

This is an experiment in using the *TypeFamily*, *PatternSynonym*, and
*ViewPattern* language extensions for convenient case matching, as well as
for learning how to use *Megaparsec*.

For future CAS related projects I plan on using *Data.Number.Symbolic* module
from **numbers-3000** as well as the **ad** package for automatic differentiation.
